# Transaction Cost Modeling System

## Overview

The Transaction Cost Modeling System provides realistic transaction cost simulation for backtesting, including bid-ask spreads, market impact, commission structures, slippage, execution delays, and partial fills. This system enables more accurate backtesting by accounting for the real-world costs that affect trading performance.

## Architecture

### Core Classes

#### TransactionCostModel

The main class that orchestrates all transaction cost calculations and simulations.

```python
from trading_rl_agent.portfolio.transaction_costs import TransactionCostModel, BrokerType

# Create a broker-specific model
cost_model = TransactionCostModel.create_broker_model(BrokerType.INSTITUTIONAL)
```

#### MarketData

Represents market conditions at a specific point in time.

```python
from trading_rl_agent.portfolio.transaction_costs import MarketData

market_data = MarketData(
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    bid=99.9,
    ask=100.1,
    mid_price=100.0,
    volume=100000,
    volatility=0.02,
    avg_daily_volume=1000000,
    market_cap=1000000000,
    sector="Technology"
)
```

#### Commission Structures

Abstract base class and implementations for different commission models.

```python
from trading_rl_agent.portfolio.transaction_costs import (
    FlatRateCommission, TieredCommission, PerShareCommission
)

# Flat rate commission
flat_commission = FlatRateCommission(rate=0.001, min_commission=1.0)

# Tiered commission
tiered_commission = TieredCommission()

# Per-share commission
per_share_commission = PerShareCommission(rate_per_share=0.005)
```

#### Market Impact Models

Models for calculating market impact of orders.

```python
from trading_rl_agent.portfolio.transaction_costs import (
    LinearImpactModel, SquareRootImpactModel, AdaptiveImpactModel
)

# Linear impact
linear_impact = LinearImpactModel(impact_rate=0.0001)

# Square root impact (Almgren et al.)
sqrt_impact = SquareRootImpactModel(impact_rate=0.00005)

# Adaptive impact
adaptive_impact = AdaptiveImpactModel()
```

#### Slippage Models

Models for calculating slippage costs.

```python
from trading_rl_agent.portfolio.transaction_costs import (
    ConstantSlippageModel, VolumeBasedSlippageModel, SpreadBasedSlippageModel
)

# Constant slippage
constant_slippage = ConstantSlippageModel(slippage_rate=0.0001)

# Volume-based slippage
volume_slippage = VolumeBasedSlippageModel()

# Spread-based slippage
spread_slippage = SpreadBasedSlippageModel(spread_multiplier=0.5)
```

#### Execution Delay Models

Models for simulating execution delays.

```python
from trading_rl_agent.portfolio.transaction_costs import (
    ConstantDelayModel, SizeBasedDelayModel, MarketConditionDelayModel
)

# Constant delay
constant_delay = ConstantDelayModel(delay_seconds=1.0)

# Size-based delay
size_delay = SizeBasedDelayModel()

# Market condition delay
market_delay = MarketConditionDelayModel()
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from trading_rl_agent.portfolio.transaction_costs import (
    TransactionCostModel, MarketData, OrderType, MarketCondition, BrokerType
)

# Create a cost model
cost_model = TransactionCostModel.create_broker_model(BrokerType.RETAIL)

# Create market data
market_data = MarketData(
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    bid=99.9,
    ask=100.1,
    mid_price=100.0,
    volume=100000,
    volatility=0.02,
    avg_daily_volume=1000000,
    market_cap=1000000000,
)

# Calculate costs for a trade
cost_breakdown = cost_model.calculate_total_cost(
    trade_value=50000,  # $50k trade
    quantity=500,       # 500 shares
    market_data=market_data,
    order_type=OrderType.MARKET,
    market_condition=MarketCondition.NORMAL,
)

print(f"Total cost: ${cost_breakdown['total_cost']:.2f}")
print(f"Cost percentage: {cost_breakdown['cost_pct']:.4f}")
```

### Simulating Order Execution

```python
# Simulate order execution with delays and partial fills
execution_result = cost_model.simulate_execution(
    requested_quantity=1000,
    market_data=market_data,
    order_type=OrderType.LIMIT,
    market_condition=MarketCondition.VOLATILE,
)

print(f"Executed quantity: {execution_result.executed_quantity}")
print(f"Executed price: ${execution_result.executed_price:.2f}")
print(f"Total cost: ${execution_result.total_cost:.2f}")
print(f"Execution delay: {execution_result.delay_seconds:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Success: {execution_result.success}")
```

### Broker-Specific Models

```python
# Different broker types have different cost structures
broker_types = [
    BrokerType.RETAIL,        # Higher commissions, simpler structure
    BrokerType.INSTITUTIONAL, # Tiered pricing, advanced features
    BrokerType.DISCOUNT,      # Low commissions, basic features
    BrokerType.PREMIUM,       # High-end features, moderate costs
    BrokerType.CRYPTO,        # Crypto-specific pricing
]

for broker_type in broker_types:
    cost_model = TransactionCostModel.create_broker_model(broker_type)
    # Use the model for cost calculations...
```

### Integration with Portfolio Manager

```python
from trading_rl_agent.portfolio import PortfolioManager, PortfolioConfig

# Create portfolio configuration with transaction cost model
config = PortfolioConfig(
    broker_type=BrokerType.INSTITUTIONAL,
    default_order_type=OrderType.MARKET,
    default_market_condition=MarketCondition.NORMAL,
)

# Initialize portfolio manager
portfolio_manager = PortfolioManager(
    initial_capital=100000,
    config=config,
)

# Execute trades with realistic transaction costs
success = portfolio_manager.execute_trade(
    symbol="AAPL",
    quantity=100,
    price=150.0,
    side="long",
    order_type=OrderType.LIMIT,
    market_condition=MarketCondition.NORMAL,
)

# Analyze transaction costs
cost_analysis = portfolio_manager.get_transaction_cost_analysis()
optimization = portfolio_manager.optimize_transaction_costs()
```

### Cost Analysis and Optimization

```python
from trading_rl_agent.portfolio.transaction_costs import TransactionCostAnalyzer

# Create analyzer
analyzer = TransactionCostAnalyzer(cost_model)

# Analyze cost trends
trends = analyzer.analyze_cost_trends()

# Calculate efficiency metrics
efficiency = analyzer.calculate_cost_efficiency_metrics()

# Generate comprehensive report
report = analyzer.generate_cost_report()
print(report)

# Get optimization recommendations
recommendations = cost_model.generate_optimization_recommendations()
for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"Recommendation: {rec.recommendation_type}")
    print(f"Expected savings: ${rec.expected_savings:,.2f}")
    print(f"Priority: {rec.priority}")
    print(f"Implementation: {rec.implementation_difficulty}")
```

## Integration with Backtesting

The transaction cost modeling system is fully integrated with the backtesting framework:

```python
from trading_rl_agent.eval import BacktestEvaluator
from trading_rl_agent.portfolio.transaction_costs import TransactionCostModel, BrokerType

# Create backtest evaluator with transaction cost model
cost_model = TransactionCostModel.create_broker_model(BrokerType.INSTITUTIONAL)
evaluator = BacktestEvaluator(config, transaction_cost_model=cost_model)

# Run backtest with realistic costs
results = evaluator.run_backtest(data, signals, strategy_name="my_strategy")

# Results include detailed cost analysis
print(f"Total transaction costs: ${results.total_transaction_costs:,.2f}")
print(f"Cost drag on returns: {results.cost_drag:.4f}")
```

- Optimize trading frequency and size

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Transaction Costs**
   - Check broker type configuration
   - Review order size relative to market volume
   - Consider using different order types
   - Analyze market condition settings

2. **Unrealistic Execution Delays**
   - Verify delay model configuration
   - Check market condition multipliers
   - Review order type settings

3. **Inconsistent Results**
   - Ensure market data is properly formatted
   - Check for missing market data fields
   - Verify cost model configuration

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Detailed Logging**

   ```python
   import logging
   logging.getLogger('trading_rl_agent.portfolio.transaction_costs').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
   ```

2. **Validate Market Data**

   ```python
   # Check market data completeness
   assert market_data.bid > 0
   assert market_data.ask > market_data.bid
   assert market_data.avg_daily_volume > 0
   ```

3. **Test Individual Components**

   ```python
   # Test commission calculation separately
   commission = cost_model.commission_structure.calculate_commission(trade_value, quantity)

   # Test market impact separately
   impact = cost_model.market_impact_model.calculate_impact(trade_value, market_data)
   ```
