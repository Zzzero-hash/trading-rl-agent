# Trading RL Agent - Knowledge Management Framework

**Date**: January 2025
**Objective**: Establish comprehensive knowledge transfer and management system
**Scope**: Complete knowledge lifecycle from development to production operations

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This framework establishes a comprehensive knowledge management system for the Trading RL Agent, ensuring smooth knowledge transfer, operational readiness, and sustainable long-term success. The system addresses four critical areas: documentation standardization, training materials, process documentation, and knowledge transfer strategy.

### **Key Objectives**

1. **Standardized Documentation**: Consistent templates, quality standards, and automated validation
2. **Comprehensive Training**: Role-specific training materials and onboarding programs
3. **Operational Processes**: Complete deployment, monitoring, and incident response procedures
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Systematic handover processes and ongoing development
